The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) is a widely used, evidence-based screening tool for anxiety. It consists of 7 simple questions about common anxiety symptoms over the past two weeks, such as nervousness, uncontrollable worry, and trouble relaxing. 
The GAD-7 can be completed by a patient alone or with a healthcare professional's support. Because it is short, reliable, and easy to score, it is frequently used in both clinical and community settings to support early detection, track symptom severity over time, and guide treatment planning. 
This tool provides a quick and private way to assess anxiety symptoms. After answering, the user can use the score to better understand their anxiety level, with specific cut-off points corresponding to minimal, mild, moderate, or severe anxiety. 
Scoring and interpretation 
0–4: Minimal anxiety
5–9: Mild anxiety
10–14: Moderate anxiety
15–21: Severe anxiety 
A score of 10 or greater is often used as a threshold to indicate probable generalized anxiety disorder, warranting further clinical evaluation. However, the GAD-7 also effectively screens for other anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
